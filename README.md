# Analysis of sounds
## Notebook: Analysis of Sounds
This notebook represents a simple analysis of three different sounds using the soundanalysis module. We will plot their waveforms, spectra, spectrograms, create a filterbank and calculate the marginal statistics of each sound.
## Notebook: Clipping Sound Files
This notebook provides a code with which you can clip (shorten) a wav sound file.
## Notebook: Analysis of Snippets and Sounds
This notebook provides a comparison of marginal statistics (mean, variance, kurtosis, skewness) between snippets of one sound, and between different sounds. We calculate marginal statistics using the values of the waveforms of a snippet or sound.
## Notebook: Analysis of Band Envelopes of Snippets and Sounds
This notebook provides a comparison of marginal statistics between band envelopes of snippets of one sound, and between band envelopes of different sound files.
## Notebook: Listening to Bands of a Sound and Visualizing Its Envelopes
In this notebook we can listen to bands of snippets of one sound and to bands of different sounds, and we can visualize each band envelope of the snippets and of the different sounds.
## Notebook: Similarity Matrix
In this notebook we will create a similarity matrix to see how different the marginal statistics of the envelopes of different sounds are. Here we subtract the marginal stats of bands (1-4) of each sound (1-4) from the marginal stats of the bands (1-4) of each sound (1-4).
